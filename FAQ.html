	<b> Question: Do Goldendoodles shed?</b>
		<div>Answer: Most Goldendoodles coats are hypoallergenic which means they have hair not fur. Shedding is very minimun to almost non existent.</div>
	<b> Question: Help!! I've had my goldendoodle Charlie for about six months now and I love him so much, but he has so much puppy energy... When did you guys notice your goldendoodles starting to calm down?</b> 
		<div>Answer: Goldendoodle puppies are very energetic! After they turn one they start to calm down and lose their puppy tendencies but they still need regular exercise. I would make sure you are taking your puppy on at least one big walk a day to help him stay calmer. 
	<b> Question: How often should I be brushing my dogs teeth/cleaning his ears? New mom here, trying my best!</b>
		<div>Answer: Brush your dogs teeth 2-3 times a week. Your dogs breath should never smell bad, that could be a sign of gum disease which can effect your dogs lungs, heart, stomach, etc in the long run. I would clean their ears every two weeks</div>
